# Mobile Development Setup with Expo Go

## Objective
Mobile development requires more resources than web development. To make the process smooth, we are using the **Expo Framework** for React Native, and testing apps with **Expo Go** on physical devices.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js LTS installed (`node -v` → vXX.XX.X)
- npm installed (`npm -v` → vX.XX.X)
- VS Code installed
- macOS (my development environment)
- A physical device (iPhone/Android) with Expo Go installed

## Steps Taken
1. Installed Expo Go:
   - iOS → via App Store  
   - Android → via Google Play Store
2. Created an Expo account and logged in.
3. Verified installation by running:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
